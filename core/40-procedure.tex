\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Prepare instrument:} Set to a small separation (e.g., 1–2\,mm) and verify with a ruler.
  \item \textbf{Subject posture:} Subject closes eyes; arm relaxed on table.
  \item \textbf{Testing rule:} Apply either one or two points gently and simultaneously for $\sim$1\,s.
  \item \textbf{Adaptive staircase:} If reported “one,” increase separation by 2–3\,mm; if “two,” decrease by 1–2\,mm.
  \item \textbf{Threshold:} Record the minimum distance identified as “two” in 3 consecutive trials.
  \item \textbf{Regions (suggested):} fingertip, palm, forearm (volar), upper arm, back, calf.
  \item \textbf{Repeat:} Collect data for both partners.
